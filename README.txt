Hi Myself Rishi Soni (Software Engineer at Cognizant).

I implemented the API Service using SpringBoot.

For the API i used,

Four basic files to run the service.

1. SapDemoApplication -To start the Service.
2. SapController      -For api calls and generating views. 
3. SapItem	       -This is pojo class to represent data and to get and set the values.
4. ItemRepo	       -For Storage, retrieval and search operations.
